    <!-- In this page we need a nav component using bs4
    
  We also need an automated carousel we can put that under the nav. The nav needs to be sticky and it needs to scale for mobile

  I have set up multiple pages for that, it looks like there is a car even list or table that we can create. Each event has a link that is an 404 error. 

  We will need reach out to the client regarding an updated list of events. We will also need to source some better quality of photos of the restraunt. (Vic may have to drive over there and take photos himself with a dlsr camera)

  The menu will need to be rewrote into chuncks of html
      We need to figure out how we want to display the menu There is a lot of stuff so think what can we do that is FAST but also nice.

  I like the idea of the sponsers as bootstrap cards. 
    
  I think Davey can take on the history page and the menu porting of content.
  
  We need to have a form for the contact us page (chase?) 

  We will need too look at font awesoem for good looking icons.
